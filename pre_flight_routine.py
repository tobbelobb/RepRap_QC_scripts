# Interactive RepRap quality control script for D3D Workshop
# (C) Torbj√∏rn Ludvigsen, 2016

# The plan:
#  * Make every step accessible to user at all times by presenting
#    them in an ipython interactive document.
#  * For all steps, present
#    - A video titled "This is supposed to happen"
#    - A button titled "Send command!"
#    - A button titled "It worked!"
#  * All quality control steps are manual, no automatic parsing of
#    firmware output takes place.
#  * When all itworked-buttons have been pushed, congratulate
#    the user with a nice looking picture.
#
## PREPARATIONS
#  Step 0:  Read this warning:
#           "Quality Control sometimes involves surprising printer behaviour.
#           Localize the power plug and be ready to pull it in case uncontrolled
#           movements or heating occurs."
#  Step 1:  Connect to printer
## DRY MOVEMENT CONTROL
#  Step 2:  Move X-axis 10 mm to the right
#  Step 3:  Move Y-axis 10 mm forwards
#  Step 4:  Move Z-axis 1 mm upwards
#  Step 5:  Test triggering, ensure untriggered enstops are really untriggered
#  Step 6:  Press and hold X-enstop, ensure firmware reacts to triggering
#  Step 7:  Press and hold Y-enstop, ensure firmware reacts to triggering
#  Step 8:  Press and hold Z-enstop, ensure firmware reacts to triggering
#  Step 9:  Home X-axis
#  Step 10: Home Y-axis
#  Step 11: Home Z-axis
## HEATED PRINTER CONTROL
#  Step 12: Read printer temperatures. Ensure within reasonable range (often between 15 and 30) degrees Celcius.
#  Step 13: Set print head temperature to 40 degrees Celcius
#  Step 14: Set print head temperature to 200 degrees Celcius
#  Step 15: Set print bed temperature to 50 degrees Celcius
#  Step 16: Home Z-axis again (auto bed level is temperature dependent)
#  Step 17: Extrude 5 mm of filament repeatedly until molten plastic emerges
#  Step 18: Print calibration cube
